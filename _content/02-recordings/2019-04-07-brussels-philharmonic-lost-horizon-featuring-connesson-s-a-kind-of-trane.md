<br>
New double CD with music by Guillaume Connesson and with soloists Timothy McAllister and Renaud Capu√ßon released by Deutsche Grammophon!<br>

Written during a brief period between 2015 (A Kind of Trane) and 2018 (Les Horizons Perdus), these four scores show the many facets of a composer who draws his inspiration from the sources of scholarly art as much as popular, without borders or taboos.

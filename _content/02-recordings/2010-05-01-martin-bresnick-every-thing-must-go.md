Most of the music on this recording honors artists whose works are going or have gone.  The compositions celebrate the work of departed masters Yehuda Amichai, Gy&#246;rgy Ligeti, Johannes Brahms and Willie Dixon (among others) and the title honors the last album recorded by Walter Becker and Donald Fagin of Steely Dan. The distinguished American composer Martin Bresnick's compositions are performed throughout the world and he is the recipient of many prizes and commissions including The Rome Prize, The Berlin Prize and a Guggenheim Fellowship, among many others.

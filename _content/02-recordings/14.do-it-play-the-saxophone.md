Timothy McAllister completed this recording project in 1998 in collaboration with noted music educator James O. Froseth called Do It! Play the Saxophone for G.I.A. Publications. Books available include alto and tenor saxophones, with over 70 minutes of music in each, including acoustical accompaniments and early improvisatory exercises.

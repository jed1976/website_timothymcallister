From mechanical stutterings framing arguably the most famous pop sax solo in history to a crooning theater ballad; from elegiac music inspired by pandemic lockdowns to jubilant outbursts of renewal and hope, **PROJECT ENCORE, VOLUME 1**, is a channel-surfing mosaic of modern composition at its finest. McAllister notes, “there is a mission and a level of musical activism behind this album, and nothing can speak to the state and richness of concert music today like the saxophone.”<br>

The collected works on this first volume, and the Ann Arbor-based duo’s third album since 2020, features the music of Nina Shekhar, Jennifer Jolley, Andre Myers, Zoe Cutler, Griffin Candey, Matthew Evan Taylor, Karalyn Schubring, Marianne Ploger, Chad “Sir Wick” Hughes, Jim Territo, Armando Bayolo, Corey Dundee, Andrés Eloy Rodriguez, and Gonzalo Garrido-Lecca.

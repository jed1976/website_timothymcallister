Quorum is pleased to announce the release of its debut CD, Cold Water Dry Stone. The disc, consisting entirely of the music of recently-named Composer-in-Residence Evan Chambers, creatively occupies these "in-between spaces." Neither strictly classical nor strictly folk music, Cold Water Dry Stone nevertheless paints a broad portrait of Chambers' musical life. Also featured is soprano Jennifer Goltz, who performs three songs on texts of Robert Tannahill (1774-1810), a poet and songwriter from Paisley, Scotland. The disc's title work was commissioned by Quorum and premiered in New York's Merkin Hall in 1999.

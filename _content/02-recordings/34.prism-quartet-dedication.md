DEDICATION features music composed in celebration of the PRISM Quartet's 20th anniversary in 2004 by a slew of today's top composers with a knack for the sax. PRISM has expanded the world of the sax quartet through their commissions and performances since 1984. Their dedication has paid off with this virtuosic showcase of instrumental acrobatics.

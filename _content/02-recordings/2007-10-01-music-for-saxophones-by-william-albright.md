The PRISM Quartet pays homage to William Albright (1944-1998) in this innova release. This remarkable disc of Albright's principal works for saxophone offers powerful testimony to the full range of his personality and his fascination with the expressive power of the instrument. A composer whose works move from sublime laments to raucous jazz, Albright created an extensive body of saxophone repertoire that is at once virtuosic, soulful, and daringly eclectic. His deep affinity for the instrument lasted throughout his career, until a long struggle with alcoholism led to his untimely death at the age of 53. Albright exerted a profound influence on the artistic development of the PRISM Quartet during the ensemble's formative years at the University of Michigan in the 1980s, inspiring them to champion new music with over 100 commissions by many of the nation's most celebrated composers.

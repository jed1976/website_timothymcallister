Heritage/Evolution, Vol. 2 is a celebration of the saxophone. The intrepid PRISM Quartet joins sax icons Ravi Coltrane, Joe Lovano, and Chris Potter to explore their instrument’s dual lineages in classical music and jazz. “But that’s just a starting point,” writes WNYC’s John Schaefer. “The works presented here reconcile two apparently divergent traditions, from totally notated scores at one end to completely free improvisation at the other, and a dizzying array of possibilities in between.”

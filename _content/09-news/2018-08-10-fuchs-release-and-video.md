August 10th marked the release of my recording on the Naxos label of Kenneth Fuchs's Saxophone Concerto 'RUSH' with the London Symphony Orchestra and Maestra JoAnn Falletta. Almost a year to the date when this was recorded in historic Abbey Road Studios, it was indescribable standing in front of that legendary ensemble. My deepest thanks to all involved! Look for it now on iTunes and other major outlets. [Here is the link to the preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyK8WoqHJj0)

Timothy McAllister joined Maestro Thomas Wilkins with the superb Buffalo Philharmonic this past weekend, showcasing two different saxophone concertos on the same program across two evenings. The Buffalo News critic Leonidas Lagrimas' full review can be found [HERE](https://buffalonews.com/2019/12/08/bpos-classical-sax-mixes-the-familiar-with-the-new/). <br>
(Excerpt)<br>
"World-renowned saxophonist Timothy McAllister's brilliant, crowd-pleasing performance was **equal parts rock-star swagger and supremely polished musicianship**.<br>
Following the full-blast intensity and crowd-pleasing pyrotechnics of "Rush," the more restrained tone and mellower lyricism of Aleksandr Glazunov’s Saxophone Concerto came across as somewhat anticlimactic (the program’s first half would have been far more effective if the Fuchs and Glazunov were reversed). Nevertheless, McAllister’s refined performance was **as good as saxophone playing gets, a masterclass in phrasing and another reminder of this instrument’s full dramatic and musical range**."

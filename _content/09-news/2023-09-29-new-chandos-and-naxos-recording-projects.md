New Album Releases on the way!<br>
<br>
Coming in November 2023, Naxos artist and Music Director of the Buffalo Philharmonic JoAnn Falletta will release a series of rarely heard American works with the National Orchestral Institute Philharmonic. Recorded at the NOI Festival in 2022, the album features Paul Creston's Concerto for Alto Saxophone and Orchestra. Often performed in its version for wind band, this recording documents the iconic saxophone work in its original orchestral instrumentation with the stunning musicians of the NOI Philharmonic.<br>
<br>
The premier, UK-based Chandos Records will release Volume 2 of the orchestral works by Kenneth Fuchs, performed by the renowned Sinfonia of London with conductor John Wilson. Featured on the album is Fuchs's "Eventide" for alto saxophone, strings, harp, celeste, and percussion. Recorded in London's historic St. Augustine Cathedral and captured by the world-famous Chandos team, the album is next in a series of critically-acclaimed projects by the orchestra.<br>
<br>
In October 2023, John Corigliano's epic "Triathlon: Concerto for Saxophonist and Orchestra" will be recorded for Naxos Records by McAllister and the Nashville Symphony under the baton of Music Director Giancarlo Guerrero. This will be a new addition to the 50+ recordings by the Nashville Symphony in their Naxos discography, which have garnered 13 GRAMMY Awards over the years. McAllister and Guerrero reunite after their heralded San Francisco Symphony debuts in April 2022, when the Corigliano concerto received its world premiere.<br>

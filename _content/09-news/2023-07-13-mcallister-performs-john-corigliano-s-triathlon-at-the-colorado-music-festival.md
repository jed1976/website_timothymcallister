Excerpt:<br>
By Libby Smith, CBS News<br>
"Audiences at the Colorado Music Festival got a real treat. World renowned concert classical saxophonist, Timothy McAllister, played three saxophones in one piece. He makes complex music and complicated fingering look easy.<br>
<br>
'Really at the core of it, it's a really beautiful work. It's just incredibly athletic,' McAllister said.<br>
<br>
The piece is so athletic it's titled 'Triathlon.' It's comprised of three movements each played with a different saxophone, soprano, alto and baritone. It's highly unusual to see them all soloed in one piece.<br>
<br>
'We rarely see them in a sequence where each movement has deep challenges that would require us to specialize on every single one of those instruments,' McAllister explained."<br>

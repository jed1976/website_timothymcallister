I was thrilled when I learned the album, "John Adams: City Noir," with the St. Louis Symphony and David Robertson received two Grammy nominations for "Best Orchestral Performance" and "Best Engineered Album." The album has also been featured on several year-end lists for top recordings of 2014, including the Detroit Free Press, San Jose Mercury News, Rhapsody and National Public Radio, as well as by independent critic's lists nationwide. It is incredible to see such attention for an album largely featuring the saxophone and new music, and I am so honored to have been a part of it.

On April 19th, tune in to www.kdfc.com at 11pm PDT/8pm EDT (3:00GMT) for the San Francisco Symphony Tuesday night broadcasts to hear the April 9 world premiere performance of John Corigliano's concerto, "Triathlon for Saxophonist and Orchestra" under the baton of Giancarlo Guerrero! Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle called the piece "a 30-minute extravaganza," with McAllister giving "the piece the knockout performance it deserved, full of rhythmic agility and dynamic power."

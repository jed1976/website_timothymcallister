Ann Arbor, Michigan - <br>
After a bit of uncertainty following its cancellation during the COVID-19 Pandemic, official word has arrived of American icon, GRAMMY, PULITZER, and ACADEMY AWARD winning composer [JOHN CORIGLIANO](http://www.johncorigliano.com/index.php?p=item5)'s new saxophone concerto, entitled TRIATHLON, to be premiered April 7-9, 2022 with the incredible San Francisco Symphony and GRAMMY-winning conductor Giancarlo Guerrerro!
<br>
<br>
The work features the soprano, alto and baritone saxophones across three movements, entitled "Leaps", "Lines", and "Licks", respectively. This nearly half-hour work explores the full potential of each of the saxophones, and tasks the soloist to perform enormous feats highlighting the intensely acrobatic, yet deeply vocal, nature of the saxophone. This is the composer's first solo work for the instrument, and his tenth concerto for solo instrument and orchestra, overall.

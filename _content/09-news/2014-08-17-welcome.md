Welcome to my new website! New to the site are downloads for presenters, a news blog, and a [press page](http://www.timothymcallister.com/john-adams-concerto) entirely devoted to the John Adams Saxophone Concerto. I hope you will enjoy the functionality of the site and many of the [new pics](http://www.timothymcallister.com/photos-info) from the photography studio of RRJONES. Look for more updates in the days ahead as final tweaks are made, but in the meantime, take a listen to the [clips](http://www.timothymcallister.com/recordings), note any upcoming [performances](http://www.timothymcallister.com/performances?year=2014) in your area, and add your name to my mailing list for updates and news. I am very grateful to Joe Dakroub for his design and assistance!

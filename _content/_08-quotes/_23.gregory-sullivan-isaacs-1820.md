title: Gregory Sullivan Isaacs - 1820
quote: '"McAllister precisely conveyed the mood of every stylistic alley into which Bolcom peered. His saxophone delivered dialogue, as well as notes, as he brought his own experiences to Bolcom&#8217;s hodgepodge of a musical canvas...the arrangement of John Williams' Catch Me If You Can score gives plenty of opportunity to display his technical wizardry and dynamic control."'

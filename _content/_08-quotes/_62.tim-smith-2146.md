title: Tim Smith - 2146
quote: 'the score deftly fuses classical and jazz elements to create a cohesive, arresting experience...it was written to match the talents of Tim McAllister, a sterling saxophonist who can handle those elements effortlessly...a kinetic, ecstatic ride that achieves giddy heights along the way...McAllister's splendid playing drew a hearty ovation from the audience and orchestra'

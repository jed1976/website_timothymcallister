title: R. Schulslaper - 1889
quote: 'Timothy McAllister is both an agile soloist, easily surmounting any technical hurdles, and an expressive, communicative musician able to plumb the depths or scale the heights of these contemporary composers&#8217; inspirations. His fellow musicians are equally accomplished; these renditions are finely honed collaborations between talented peers.'

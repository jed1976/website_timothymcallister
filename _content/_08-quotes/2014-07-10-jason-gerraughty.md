"Both violinist Leila Josefewicz and saxophonist Timothy McAllister gave incredible performances this evening. The demands on the soloists in both pieces are similar: nearly constant playing, long (LONG) phrases, and sections requiring pure athleticism. McAllister was the eye of a storm in his performance, delivering endless cascades of notes with Zen-like control, and acrobatic grace...Adams&#8217;s Saxophone Concerto is a solid new contribution to a genre that is undeservedly underrepresented. The star of the show was, hands down, McAllister, whose prowess portends great things to come, not just for himself, but for the presence of saxophones in the classical concert hall"

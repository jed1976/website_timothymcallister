title: Lawrence A. Johnson - 1826
quote: 'Dudamel led a bracing, propulsive performance with instrumental lines clear even in Adams&#8217; most riotous contrapuntal moments. The L.A. Phil members covered themselves in glory with outstanding contributions...especially, Timothy McAllister&#8217;s evocative and bravura alto sax playing.'

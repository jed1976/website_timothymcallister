title: David Fleshler - 1935
quote: 'Handling the extensive saxophone solos was guest musician Timothy McAllister, who performed the work&#8217;s world premiere and who was brought in at Adams&#8217; request. Although seated in the middle of the orchestra, he stood for the solos and played the jazz-inspired riffs in a nervy, improvisatory style, a highlight of what was a fine performance.

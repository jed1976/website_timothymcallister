quote: 'Adams's concerto followed, full of impatient energy, nods to various styles of music and some wildly intense saxophone lines...the piece was full of saxophone pyrotechnics that McAllister played with command and ease. He moved gracefully from a bold, brassy sound to mellow, almost vocal strains, playing with the precision and polish of a classical player and a musical freedom that made much of the piece sound improvised on the spot'

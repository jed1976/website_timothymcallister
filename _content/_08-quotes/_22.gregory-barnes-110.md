quote: 'In Jennifer Higdon&#8217;s 2007 Soprano Saxophone Concerto, Tim McAllister was equally amazing. He produced a clearly focused sound in all registers &#8212; and some were very extreme...Higdon&#8217;s formal organization also is quite free, but her single-movement concept kept musical ideas fairly compact. McAllister&#8217;s artistry helped.'

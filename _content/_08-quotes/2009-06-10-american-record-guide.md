Timothy McAllister and Kathryn Goodson attain sparkling heights on In Transit, a recording of saxophone and piano pieces. The range of style is broad. Etezady's Streetlegal, commissioned by the duo, is a pleasingly violent, bravura flourish of an opening. Albright's Sonata is gripping, deftly binding sections of scintillating textures with more melodically based passages. The roles of alto saxophone and piano are fluid and intimately interactive, forming a strong partnership. The second movement, a lament for a deceased friend, is profoundly sad and beautifully played. III and IV allow further exciting opportunity for the players to flutter, flit, and dance madly. The first two works alone reveal the scope of the performers' skill and the scope of the repertoire. The Babbitt adeptly covers wide rhythmic and pitch territory in under two minutes. Wanamaker's brief, energetic sonata (commissioned by McAllister) explores different types of motion and energy (moto perpetuo, stasis, and 'rondo psycho'), themes that run through the entire program. Zupko's title work, commissioned by McAllister, is a series of impressionist movements, each presenting a different mood, but all containing shared melodic material.

title: Richard Morrison - 2204
quote: 'the main attraction of this enjoyable St. Louis Symphony album, conducted by David Robertson, is Adams' Saxophone Concerto, composed for the virtuosic Timothy McAllister, who plays it here. Stacked with swing-era allusions, moody 4am interludes and cartwheeling acrobatics, it is unpretentious fun from start to finish'

title: Edward Oriz - 123
quote: 'It was Higdon's concerto that offered the most sublime musical moments on the program...her saxophone concerto is an extremely lyrical piece whose ideas are clear and free of musical meandering...The work was played with warmth and agility by saxophonist Timothy McAllister...In the realm of contemporary music, finding a jewel amid the programmed mix is a rare music moment. And this concert delivered it with Higdon's concerto.'

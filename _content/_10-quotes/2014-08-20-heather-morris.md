"This was a virtuosic performance by guest soloist Tim McAllister for whom it was written and whom Adams introduced as 'the best saxophone player in the world today.' Its angular, leaping melodic outbursts form a contrast to the other pieces on the program, but there are no extended techniques required, just amazing agility in the natural range of the instrument. Its two movements rely on tight rhythmic precision as it proceeds resolutely onwards through a myriad of polyrhythms, its jazz influences lying just below the surface at all times. In the slow movement's sultry mood, the velvet tone of McAllister's playing was magnificent."

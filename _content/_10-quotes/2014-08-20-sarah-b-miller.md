"This new recording reunites conductor, orchestra and record label and adds a first-class soloist, saxophonist Timothy McAllister. “City Noir,” which gets some of its inspiration from movies like “Double Indemnity,” begins with hyperkinetic power shifting to ominous quiet and melancholy passages for McAllister’s soulful alto sax...performances are all superb…the jazz-filled Saxophone Concerto was written specifically for McAllister, and his performance, well-supported by Robertson, is amazing."

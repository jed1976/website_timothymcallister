"The star of the show was the saxophonist Timothy McAllister, all pep and bounce and loose-limbed lyricism in John Adamsâ€™s 2013 Saxophone Concerto. It reads like a love letter to the giants of be-bop and swing, with orchestration as plush as a velvet banquette, honeyed harmonies from a choir of flutes and clarinets, and mirror-ball figures for celesta. At ease and alert, McAllister dazzled and crooned, passing a new idea to the leader Laura Samuel, then on to the clarinettist James Burke. The material is slender but brilliantly scored, an American dream of neon signage and slick city streets."

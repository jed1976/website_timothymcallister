[Review: "Albany Symphony, Cheng and McAllister in top form"]<br>
To finish the evening, John Corigliano’s “Triathlon for Saxophonist and Orchestra” would be hard to beat. With Grammy-winning saxophonist Timothy McAllister as the star, the piece is not only a tour de force for the saxophone but also for the orchestra...the overall effect was buoyant, bold, funky, and very in-your-face confident...as they say in jazz terms, he wailed on the part with great energy and Miller and the gang followed suit."

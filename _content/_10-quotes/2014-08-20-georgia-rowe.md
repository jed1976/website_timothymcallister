[Review: "Adams' Concerto Saxophone Concerto gets astonishing performance"]
"John Adams' Saxophone Concerto demonstrated that the instrument most often associated with jazz, blues and soul is perfectly capable of taking center stage on an orchestral program. Composed in 2013 for saxophonist Timothy McAllister, who premiered it last year with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and who served as Saturday's excellent soloist, the 30-minute piece was exhilaratingâ€¦the solo writing is mercurial: McAllister's playing was edgy and insistent one moment, velvety-smooth the next...McAllister was astonishing: the soloist's part is hugely demanding, and the saxophonist negotiated it with utter assurance. No wonder Adams, who was in the audience, called him 'the best in the world.' "

"Timothy McAllister played the insanely difficult solo part with the bold confidence and high energy of an A-list bopper in full tiltâ€¦again and again, the composer [Adams] calls upon McAllister to develop a melodic fragment in ever-lengthening and ever more intense iterations. McAllister, de Waart and the MSO seized avidly on these patterns of growth. They made the music as wildly thrilling as Adams surely intended it to be."

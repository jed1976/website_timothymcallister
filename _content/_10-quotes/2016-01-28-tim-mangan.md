"Couched in Adamsâ€™ latter-day style in which fractured rhythms and thematic units exist within a potent stream of pulsation, the Saxophone Concerto also draws upon jazz influences, its soloist tumbling this way and that in pseudo-improvisatory vein...McAllister, a phenomenal technician, played it all smoothly, with classical restraint...Robertson and the St. Louis Symphony excelled in the mysteriously dappled, feinting and jabbing accompaniment."

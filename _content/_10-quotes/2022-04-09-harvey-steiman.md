"It is a formidable challenge for a saxophonist to make the composer’s astonishing range of sounds flow as smoothly and enticingly as McAllister does, nor is it a given that the intricate rhythmic give-and-take between soloist and conductor Giancarlo Guerrero could fall into place as merrily as it did with the San Francisco Symphony at Davies Symphony Hall. The results, however, were nothing short of exhilarating.<br>
...the thrills come partly from McAllister’s virtuosity but also from Corigliano’s fertile orchestral imagination. It is heady stuff, and I for one can’t wait to hear this again."<br>

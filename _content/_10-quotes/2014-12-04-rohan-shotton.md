[REVIEW: "Adolphe Sax's 200th celebrated in style in Liverpool with Adams' concerto"] "John Adams' Saxophone Concerto, premiered just last year, was received with enthusiastic whoops, and with good reason. Its greatest champion, the soloist Timothy McAllister, painted it with a rich spectrum of sonic colour in addition to offering an astounding display of virtuosity. His technical facility did a great deal for the soft fluidity of the early parts of the concerto, especially in the tranquillo passages. The sustained intensity of the second movement, as it went on, made his ongoing displays all the more impressive for his remarkable stamina…The large ovation was richly deserved; here, surely, is a work which demands to be programmed regularly in the coming years."

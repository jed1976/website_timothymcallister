PRISM Quartet presents an expansive program of extraordinary new works, featuring the New York premieres of "Old Tune Renewed," commissioned for PRISM by Harvard University’s Fromm Music Foundation from MacArthur Fellow Bright Sheng, and "Graffiti II" by Tomás Luis de Victoria Prize-winner Roberto Sierra, commissioned by the Musical Fund Society for PRISM in celebration of the Society’s 200th anniversary. Also on the program are world premieres of works by rising-star composers: winners of three PRISM Quartet student commissioning awards: Jungyoon Wie, Flannery Cunningham, and Julian Hofstetter.

John Adams - American composer extraordinaire - takes to the podium to present an explosive display of contemporary ingenuity and magic. Said to be "loud, tough and organized," Julia Wolfe's Arsenal packs a punch! With trumpets and trombones on the front lines, she drew inspiration from one of FDR's Fireside Chats. Bart&#243;k uses a bagpipe-like tune to convey the Eastern European and Middle Eastern folk flavor in his Dance Suite, and in a gripping finale, Adams leads his own City Noir, inspired by Kevin Starr's "Dream" books that, to him, contain "pockets of high-energy and cinematic lyricism."

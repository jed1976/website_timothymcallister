Born in the early 1960s in the underground scene in San Francisco and New York, minimalism and its offshoots (post-minimalism, totalism) have become wildly popular forms of new classical music. The PRISM Quartet performs music by two of its originators and long-time champions, Terry Riley and Philip Glass, along with composers deeply influenced by their work, including John Adams, Michael Torke, and Matt Johns, winner of the 2011 PRISM Quartet/Walden School Commissioning Award.

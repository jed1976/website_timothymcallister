Steven Mackey is an electric guitarist and composer whose concert music is influenced by all the jazz and rock he’s played. The World Premiere of his new, 45-minute orchestral work is followed by Reich’s moving three-act video opera (2002) about advancing technology, created in tandem with visual artist Beryl Korot and combining projections with live performers.

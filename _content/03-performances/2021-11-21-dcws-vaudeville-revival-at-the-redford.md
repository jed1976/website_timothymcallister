Nearly one hundred years ago during the “Roaring Twenties,” Detroit was a leading center of Vaudeville and Variety music. Detroit and its many theaters were destinations for musicians everywhere. The Redford Theatre was one such venue, which comes alive again with the sounds of Vaudeville featuring DCWS core musician and University of Michigan Professor of Saxophone, Timothy McAllister. He will be joined by pianist Liz Ames and members of the University of Michigan Saxophone Ensemble.<br>

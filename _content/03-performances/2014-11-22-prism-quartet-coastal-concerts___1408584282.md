Coastal Concerts’ November offering will be a long-overdue “first.”  Although there have been woodwind and brass groups featured in previous seasons, the saxophone has never before been highlighted. And this time the audience will be treated to four virtuosos on this unique and versatile instrument, which is technically a member of the wind family but has many brass characteristics.

LiveConnections brings you unique collaborations and fresh sounds from some of the best artists today, in the intimate atmosphere of World Cafe Live. LiveConnections is pairing Grammy-nominated pianist and composer Uri Caine, “a musical polymath with abundant improvising skills” (NPR), with the acclaimed PRISM Quartet for a concert of adventurous new music. Building on the artists’ reputations as innovators, LiveConnections has commissioned Caine to write a quintet for piano and saxophones that fuses modern jazz and new classical styles. The program also features music by Dutch avant-pop composer Jacob TV from PRISM’s Pitch Black CD, and recent solo piano music by Caine.

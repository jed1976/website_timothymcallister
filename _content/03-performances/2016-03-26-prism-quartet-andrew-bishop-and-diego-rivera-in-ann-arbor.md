PRISM is joined by jazz saxophone greats Diego Rivera and Andrew Bishop for three works on the program: Improvisations by Chris Potter, “one of the most studied (and copied) saxophonists on the planet” (DownBeat), Found by PRISM’s own Matthew Levy, and Dave Liebman’s arrangement of John Coltrane’s ballad, Dear Lord. The program also spotlights PRISM in performances of “Radical Alignment” from 15 Places At The Same Time by Steve Lehman, Leafless Trees by David Laganella, and the world premiere of Schumann Bouquet, Pulitzer Prize-winner William Bolcom’s new adaptation of piano works by Robert Schumann.

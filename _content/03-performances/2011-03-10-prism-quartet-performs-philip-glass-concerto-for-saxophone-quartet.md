Mixing Eastern and Western traditions, Philip Glass' heroic musical homage to a simple Hindu holy man paints an exquisite symphonic and choral picture of India emerging from centuries of foreign domination. Glass' saxophone concerto as well as a piece by Glass and Ravi Shankar fill out this south Asian odyssey.

Clinic: "Building Better Bridges: Modern Pedagogy for the Emerging Saxophonist"

Synopsis:
This clinic tackles the ever-evolving prerequisites for emerging, school-aged saxophonists, particularly those ultimately wishing to pursue demanding study at the collegiate level in performance or music education. Saxophone pedagogy is still in its adolescence, and many misconceptions pervade early training on the instrument. Topics for this session cover strategies for assisting students with tone, technique, multiple-tonguing, and altissimo; problems that go undiagnosed for years; and the skills collegiate professors have grown to expect from matriculating students.

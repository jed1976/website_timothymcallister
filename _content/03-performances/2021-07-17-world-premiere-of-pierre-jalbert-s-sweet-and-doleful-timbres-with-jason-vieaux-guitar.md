Two Grammy Award-winners, saxophonist Timothy McAllister and guitarist Jason Vieaux team up for their Summer Festival debuts performing the world premiere of an exciting CMNW commission by American composer Pierre Jalbert. The folk idiom of Béla Bartók’s Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, the most dramatic work of this summer festival, caps this memorable program full of wide-ranging instrumental colors and ensembles, including the Dover Quartet.

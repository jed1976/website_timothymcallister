message: "Well, I've never heard of Yiruma before (sp?).  Beautiful piece of music.  I'm a huge fan of Jim Brickman; are you fmlaiiar with his work?  I've been to several concerts of his, most recently at Christmas!  Piano music is a favorite of mine.  I love the stories painted through these artists.Creativity is a knack we all possess.  It simply manifests its worth in a variety of ways.  Hoping to  zero  in on some of mine this week when the kids return to school.blessings and peace~elaine"

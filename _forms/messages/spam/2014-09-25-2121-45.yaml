message: "David McCullough's John Adams is extraordinarily thuroogh, and based largely on Adams' personal correspondence. It shows his close, loving relationship with his wife, his differences with Jefferson and the struggle to sustain an American democracy through infancy. A masterful work! Make the time and enjoy it!"

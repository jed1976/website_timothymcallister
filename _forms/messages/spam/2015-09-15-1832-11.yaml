  Brian Geltzeiler, from HoopsCritic.com, joined the show to discuss the headlines from the hardwood. 
  It    s been all bad news for the Wizards since the All-Star Break, most blatantly last night against the Golden State Warriors. The Wiz only    managed to score 8 points in the 3rd quarter. Brian says the    Wizards problems may go beyond the basketball court. 
  He also says that if you鈥檙e a fan of Kevin Durant or the Thunder, the most recent injury to Durant鈥檚 foot is a big area of    concern, especially with this being a contract year for    the superstar. 
  Listen in to find out what Brian thinks about coaches taking blame for players injuries    and which teams are setting themselves up for a successful playoff run.<br>
